        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi. I'm Michael, and in 2016 I went back to get my MBA from UT Chattanooga. Previously, I worked in the music business and hospitality industries - holding titles like Prep Cook, Server, Barista, Gourmet Chef, and Recording Artist & Small Business Owner. Since starting my corporate career, I've earned an average of 20% increases, earned two promotions, and learned new skills such as data analytics and web development (I coded this website myself). More importantly, I've learned how HR and Finance departments think about employee compensation. As an "insider", I have unfortunately learned that those decisions are not always in the best interest of the employee. <strong>I want to help you make the most money you can in your career.</strong></p>

                <ol class="sal-list">
                    <li>Be a good worker (if you're lazy, it's hard to justify asking for more money).</li>
                    <li>Know your value (e.g., what is the market paying for the job I want?)</li>
                    <li>You can make more money if you switch companies.</li>
